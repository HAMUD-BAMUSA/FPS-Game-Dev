Hello and Welcome
this is my first time Developing a game, by no means is it the best you can always find better but feel free to expnad on it and also inform me on any things that i can improve upon
The bunny hopping mechanism need a little tinkering with
Most of the assets used are free and open source also i learned this from many Youtube videos so i wont claim completely that this work is mine alone neither should you
thank you and i hope this helps you
